Trismovies is a cinema site I made for a school project. It consists of a movie catalog that makes use of some of [TMDB's](https://www.themoviedb.org) endpoints. Like using their endpoint to get the most popular movies, movies based on a string query and requesting movie details by sending the movies ID. I have also created a page for movies that are now playing in "my cinema". They have their simple C(R)UD functions that you can make use of when logged in as an admin.
